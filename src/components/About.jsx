                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Luis ðŸ‘‹ A software engineer with a background in systems engineering and IT support, passionate about building intuitive, human-centered web applications. I specialize in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Django, and PostgreSQL, and I love turning complex challenges into clean, scalable solutions.

With a strong foundation in algorithms and system designâ€”and a mindset shaped by real-world troubleshootingâ€”I bring adaptability, collaboration, and curiosity to every project. Iâ€™m constantly learning, always iterating, and deeply motivated by the impact technology can have on peopleâ€™s lives.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll probably find me outdoors soaking up the sun, working out, diving into a new topic, or marathoning movies.</p>
